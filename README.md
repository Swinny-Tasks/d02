# Wireless Message Communication
### WIP ðŸš§ 
This project is a wireless message communication system that enables a text message to be conveyed between two software programs by making use of a visible light channel. The text message is converted into ASCII characters, with each character composed of eight binary bits, ultimately forms a stream of bits transmitted from the transmitter to the receiver.
